# Home Automation

![](/files/home-auto.webp)

For over two years, I have been working with Home automation systems. I am skilled in
working with Open Hab, Home Assistant, Node Red, and ESP8266/ESP32 Modules. My
experience and skillset allow me to ensure a smooth installation, optimum performance,
and outstanding reliability.
